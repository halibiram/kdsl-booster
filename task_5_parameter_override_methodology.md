# Task 5: MA5608T Parameter Override Investigation Methodology

This document details a methodology for investigating configuration parameter overrides on the Huawei MA5608T. The research aims to understand the configuration hierarchy, discover hidden parameters, and identify non-standard methods for modifying device behavior, with a focus on defensive security applications.

## Phase 1: Default Configuration and Hierarchy Analysis

This phase focuses on establishing a baseline by documenting the factory default state and understanding how different configuration layers interact.

### Methodology:

1.  **Document Factory Defaults:**
    *   **Objective:** Obtain a complete record of the device's out-of-the-box configuration.
    *   **Process:**
        *   On a factory-reset device, execute commands like `display factory-configuration` and `display current-configuration` and save the output.
        *   Document the location and contents of the primary configuration file (e.g., `vrpcfg.zip`) using the `display startup` and `dir` commands.

2.  **Analyze Configuration Priority:**
    *   **Objective:** Determine which configuration source takes precedence when settings conflict.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Design a series of experiments to test the hierarchy. For example:
            *   Set a parameter (e.g., a timeout value) at the global level.
            *   Apply a different value for the same parameter within a specific service profile.
            *   Apply a third value directly on a port where that profile is active.
        *   Use `display` commands to observe which value is currently in effect for the port. This will reveal the order of precedence (typically port > profile > global).
        *   Document this hierarchy, as it is critical for understanding which settings can be overridden and how.

## Phase 2: Parameter Modification Testing

This phase involves systematically probing the device's parameters to understand their limits and uncover hidden functionality.

### Methodology:

1.  **Test Documented Parameter Ranges:**
    *   **Objective:** Verify and push the boundaries of known configuration parameters.
    *   **Process:**
        *   For a selection of key parameters (e.g., data rates, power levels, queue sizes), test the full documented range.
        *   Attempt to configure values just outside the documented range (e.g., if range is 1-100, test 0 and 101).
        *   Observe the system's response: does it provide a clear error message, silently fail, accept the value, or crash? Documenting the error handling is a key part of this.

2.  **Discover Undocumented Parameters and Interdependencies:**
    *   **Objective:** Find hidden parameters and understand how different settings interact.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Use the list of potential hidden commands and parameters from the firmware analysis in Task 4.
        *   Attempt to apply these in the CLI to see if they are accepted.
        *   Test for interdependencies. For example, changing a primary mode (e.g., `vdsl mode standard` vs. `vdsl mode super-vector`) may expose an entirely new set of sub-parameters. Systematically toggle primary modes and then re-enumerate all available commands and parameters in that context.

## Phase 3: Advanced Configuration Methods Research

This phase investigates alternative, non-standard paths for modifying the device's configuration, which could bypass normal validation checks.

### Methodology:

1.  **Bootloader Parameter Manipulation:**
    *   **Objective:** Determine if configuration can be influenced at the bootloader (BootROM) level.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Research the procedure for interrupting the MA5608T's boot sequence (e.g., by sending a specific key combination like Ctrl+B over the console connection at power-on).
        *   If a bootloader menu is accessible, document all available commands.
        *   Look for options to set boot-time parameters, specify an alternative configuration file to load, or disable the loading of the main configuration file entirely. Such an override could be used to boot the device into a minimal or default state, bypassing the operator's saved configuration.

2.  **Configuration File Injection:**
    *   **Objective:** Test the robustness of the configuration file parser by manually editing a config file.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Use the device's backup feature to download the configuration file (e.g., via FTP/TFTP).
        *   Decompress the file if necessary (e.g., `unzip vrpcfg.zip`).
        *   Manually edit the text-based configuration file to include undocumented parameters or values outside their normal range.
        *   Re-compress and upload the modified file back to the device.
        *   Reboot the device and observe the results. Does the device reject the file due to a checksum error? Does it load the file but ignore the invalid lines? Or does it accept the invalid parameters, effectively bypassing the CLI's validation logic?

## Phase 4: Safety and Integrity Mechanism Analysis

This final phase studies the device's built-in protective features designed to prevent misconfiguration and ensure stability. This is critical for developing defensive recommendations.

### Methodology:

1.  **Analyze Parameter Validation Logic:**
    *   **Objective:** Document how the system handles invalid input across all interfaces.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Leverage the findings from Phase 2 and 3.
        *   Categorize the responses to invalid input: graceful error, silent failure, unstable behavior, crash.
        *   A robust system should always fail gracefully with a clear error message.

2.  **Investigate Configuration Integrity Checks:**
    *   **Objective:** Determine if configuration files are protected against tampering.
    *   **Process:**
        *   As part of the configuration injection test in Phase 3, observe if the device reports a checksum, hash, or signature mismatch when loading a modified file.
        *   This indicates the presence of an integrity check, which is a key security feature.

3.  **Test Rollback and Failsafe Mechanisms:**
    *   **Objective:** Verify the reliability of the device's safety nets.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Test the two-phase commit system if present. Make a series of potentially disruptive changes, but do not `commit` them. Reboot the device and verify that it correctly reverts to the last committed configuration.
        *   Test the `reboot` command's confirmation timer. If the user does not confirm the reboot after a major change, does the system correctly roll back?
        *   Document the exact procedure for a factory reset and test if there are any software-based protections that can prevent it from being executed.

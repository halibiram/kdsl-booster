# ISP-Specific Exploits Database - Final Report

## Introduction

This report details the findings of a security assessment of DSLAM equipment used by major Turkish ISPs: Türk Telekom, Superonline, Turknet, and Vodafone. The assessment focused on identifying potential vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and recommended security countermeasures for each provider's commonly used hardware. The primary goal is to improve the security posture of the network infrastructure.

## 1. Türk Telekom

### DSLAM Model: Huawei MA5608T

#### Potential Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Techniques

*   **Default Credentials:**
    *   **Username:** `root`
    *   **Password:** `admin` (for older firmware) or `admin123` (for R017 and newer firmware).
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker with network access to the management interface could gain administrative control by using these default credentials if they have not been changed.

*   **Default IP Address:**
    *   **IP Address:** `10.11.104.2`
    *   **Exploitation:** If the management network is not properly segmented, an attacker could attempt to connect to this default IP address to access the management interface.

*   **Access Methods:**
    *   The primary management protocol is Telnet, which transmits credentials in cleartext.
    *   Serial console and, on some models, SSH are also available.

#### Advanced Topics

*   **Profile Unlocking (VDSL 50 -> 100 Mbps):** No public information was found on user-level exploits. This is controlled by the ISP's provisioning system.
*   **G.inp Disabling for Lower Latency:** No specific exploits were found. This is a line profile parameter controlled by the ISP. Disabling it could impact line stability.

#### Recommended Security Countermeasures

*   **Change Default Credentials:** Immediately change the default `root` password.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the management interface using a dedicated VLAN.
*   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Restrict management access to authorized IP addresses.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable Telnet in favor of SSH.
*   **Firmware Updates:** Regularly update firmware to patch known vulnerabilities.

## 2. Superonline

### DSLAM Model: Nokia ISAM 7330

#### Potential Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Techniques

*   **Default Credentials:**
    *   **Username:** `isadmin`
    *   **Password:** `Ans#150`
    *   **Exploitation:** Default credentials could allow an attacker with network access to gain full administrative control of the device.

#### Advanced Topics

*   **TL1 Command Automation:** No specific vulnerabilities were found, but if an attacker gains management access, they could use TL1 commands to disrupt service or extract data.
*   **Vectoring Optimization:** No exploits were found. This is a complex feature managed by the ISP.

#### Recommended Security Countermeasures

*   **Change Default Credentials:** Immediately change the default `isadmin` password.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the management interface.
*   **ACLs:** Restrict management access to authorized personnel.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Services:** Disable or restrict access to TL1 if not required.
*   **Firmware Updates:** Keep firmware current.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Log and monitor all management access to detect unauthorized activity.

## 3. Turknet

### DSLAM Model: ZTE C300

#### Potential Vulnerabilities and Exploitation Techniques

*   **Default Credentials:**
    *   **Username:** `zte`
    *   **Password:** `zte`
    *   **Exploitation:** Default credentials present a significant risk if not changed.

*   **Default IP Address:**
    *   **IP Address:** `136.1.1.100`
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker could attempt to connect to this default IP if the management network is accessible.

*   **Web Interface Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Public CVEs for other ZTE products suggest a risk of vulnerabilities like SQL injection in the web interface.
    *   **Exploitation:** An attacker could use web exploits to gain unauthorized access.

#### Advanced Topics

*   **SNMP Manipulation for Speed Boost:** No public information was found. Speed profiles are controlled by the ISP's provisioning system.
*   **INP Reduction Methods:** No exploits were found. This is a line parameter controlled by the ISP.

#### Recommended Security Countermeasures

*   **Change Default Credentials:** Immediately change the default `zte` password.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the management interface.
*   **ACLs:** Restrict management access.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Protect the web interface with a WAF.
*   **Firmware Updates:** Keep firmware current.
*   **Secure SNMP:** If used, change default community strings and use SNMPv3.

## 4. Vodafone

#### DSLAM Vendor Identification

*   The specific DSLAM vendor for Vodafone Turkey is not publicly known and may vary by region. Identification would require network analysis (banner grabbing, SNMP queries) or physical inspection.

#### General Attack Vectors (Vendor Agnostic)

*   **Profile Forcing:** Highly unlikely from the user end. This would require compromising the ISP's provisioning systems or using social engineering.
*   **Bonding Exploitation:** No common exploits exist. Attacks would likely be limited to Denial of Service by disrupting one of the bonded lines.

#### Recommended Security Countermeasures

*   **Strong Access Control:** Enforce strong, unique passwords and centralized authentication (TACACS+/RADIUS).
*   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate management networks.
*   **Regular Audits:** Audit configurations and logs for unauthorized access.
*   **Physical Security:** Secure physical access to DSLAMs in street cabinets.
*   **Employee Training:** Train staff to recognize and prevent social engineering attacks.

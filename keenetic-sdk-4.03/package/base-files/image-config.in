menuconfig INITOPT
	bool "Init configuration options" if IMAGEOPT
	default n
	help
		These option choose the command that will run as the 'init' command
		(that is which is responsible for controlling the system once preinit
		transfers control to it) as well as some options controlling its
		behaviour.  Normally init is /sbin/init.

	config TARGET_INIT_PATH
		string
		prompt "PATH for regular boot" if INITOPT
		default "/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin"
		help
			Default PATH used during normal operation

	config TARGET_INIT_ENV
		string
		prompt "Environment variables to set when starting init (start with none)" if INITOPT
		default ""
		help
			Should be a space seperated list of variable assignments.  These
			variables will be present in the environment.  Spaces may not be
			present (including through expansion) even in a quoted string
			(env doesn't understanding quoting).

	config TARGET_INIT_CMD
		string
		prompt "Init command" if INITOPT
		default "/sbin/init"
		help
			The executable to run as the init process.  Is 'exec'd by
			preinit (which is the init that the kernel launches on boot).

	config TARGET_INIT_SUPPRESS_STDERR
		bool
		prompt "Suppress stderr messages of init" if INITOPT
		default y
		help
			Prevents showing stderr messages for init command if not already
			suppressed during preinit.  This is the default behaviour in
			previous versions of OpenWRT.  Removing this does nothing if
			stderr is suppressed during preinit (which is the default).


menuconfig VERSIONOPT
	bool "Version configuration options" if IMAGEOPT
	default n
	help
		These options allow to override the version information embedded in
		the /etc/openwrt_version, /etc/openwrt_release, /etc/banner and
		/etc/opkg.conf files. Usually there is no need to set these, but
		they're useful for release builds or custom OpenWrt redistributions
		that should carry custom version tags.

	config VERSION_DIST
		string
		prompt "Release distribution" if VERSIONOPT
		default "OpenWrt" if VERSIONOPT
		help
			This is the name of the release distribution.
			If unspecified, it defaults to OpenWrt.

	config VERSION_NICK
		string
		prompt "Release version nickname" if VERSIONOPT
		default "Attitude Adjustment" if VERSIONOPT
		help
			This is the release codename embedded in the image.
			If unspecified, it defaults to the name of source branch.

	config VERSION_NUMBER
		string
		prompt "Release version number" if VERSIONOPT
		help
			This is the release version number embedded in the image.
			If unspecified, it defaults to the svn or git-svn revision
			of the build tree.

	config VERSION_REPO
		string
		prompt "Release repository" if VERSIONOPT
		default "http://downloads.openwrt.org/attitude_adjustment/12.09-rc1/%S/packages" if VERSIONOPT
		help
			This is the repository address embedded in the image, it defaults
			to the trunk snapshot repo; the url may contain the following placeholders:
			 %R .. Revision number
			 %V .. Release version or revision number, uppercase
			 %v .. Release version or revision number, lowercase
			 %C .. Release version or "Bleeding Edge", uppercase
			 %c .. Release version or "bleeding_edge", lowercase
			 %N .. Release name, uppercase
			 %n .. Release name, lowercase
			 %D .. Distribution name or "OpenWrt", uppercase
			 %d .. Distribution name or "openwrt", lowercase

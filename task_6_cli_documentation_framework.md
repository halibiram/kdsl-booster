# Task 6: Huawei DSL CLI Command Documentation Framework

This document details a framework for systematically enumerating, documenting, and analyzing the Command Line Interface (CLI) for Huawei DSLAMs running the Versatile Routing Platform (VRP). The goal is to create a comprehensive, security-focused CLI reference for educational and defensive purposes.

## Phase 1: Command Enumeration

This phase outlines a systematic process for discovering the full range of available CLI commands, including those that may be hidden or undocumented.

### Methodology:

1.  **Interactive Exploration:**
    *   **Objective:** Discover commands accessible to a given user.
    *   **Process:**
        *   **Contextual Help:** In each CLI mode (user view `<Huawei>`, system view `[Huawei]`, interface view `[Huawei-interface-...]`, etc.), use the `?` key to list all available commands in the current context.
        *   **Tab Completion:** Use the `Tab` key to explore possible command completions and parameters.
        *   **Privilege Level Mapping:** Log in with users of different privilege levels (0-15) and repeat the enumeration process for each level. This will map commands to the minimum privilege required to execute them.

2.  **Offline Analysis:**
    *   **Objective:** Discover commands that may not be visible through interactive help.
    *   **Process:**
        *   **Configuration File Parsing:** Analyze saved configuration files (`display current-configuration`). These files contain a flat list of the commands used to create the current state, which can reveal command syntax and structure.
        *   **Firmware String Analysis:** Use the methodology from Task 4 (Phase 2) to run `strings` on the firmware binary and `grep` for potential command names or keywords. This is the primary method for discovering potentially hidden or diagnostic commands.

## Phase 2: Command Documentation Structure

This phase defines a standardized template for documenting each discovered command. A consistent structure is essential for creating a useful and readable reference.

### Methodology:

For each command, create a documentation entry using the following Markdown template:

---

**Command:** `display version`

*   **Syntax:**
    ```
    display version
    ```

*   **Context(s):**
    *   User View (`<Huawei>`)
    *   System View (`[Huawei]`)
    *   *Can be run from any view.*

*   **Privilege Level:** 0 (User)

*   **Description:**
    Displays detailed information about the device's hardware and software versions, including the VRP version, firmware patch version, and device uptime.

*   **Parameters:**
    *   None.

*   **Example Usage:**
    ```
    <Huawei>display version
    Huawei Versatile Routing Platform Software
    VRP (R) software, Version 5.170 (MA5608T V800R018C10)
    ...
    ```
*   **Security Notes:**
    *   Provides detailed version information that could be valuable to an attacker for vulnerability correlation. Access should be logged.

## Phase 3: Automation Script Development

This phase focuses on creating a framework for developing educational scripts that demonstrate how to automate common administrative tasks using the CLI.

### Methodology:

1.  **Define Core Automation Tasks:**
    *   **Objective:** Identify key tasks that benefit from automation.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   **Configuration Backup:** A script that logs in, executes `display current-configuration`, and saves the output to a dated file.
        *   **Bulk Provisioning:** A template script that takes a list of MAC addresses or port numbers and provisions a standard service profile on each.
        *   **Monitoring Data Collection:** A script that periodically collects the output of key diagnostic commands (`display alarm active`, `display dsl line-status`) and formats it for ingestion into a monitoring system.
        *   **Diagnostic Automation:** A script that automates a diagnostic workflow, such as testing a port, displaying its status, and clearing its statistics.

2.  **Develop Script Templates:**
    *   **Objective:** Create reusable script templates using a suitable language.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Use Python with the `paramiko` or `netmiko` library for SSH automation.
        *   For each core task, create a well-commented template script. The template should have clear sections for user-configurable variables (IP address, credentials, input file), the core logic for executing commands and parsing output, and error handling.

## Phase 4: Security-Focused Documentation

This final phase integrates security analysis directly into the CLI documentation, highlighting commands and practices with significant security implications.

### Methodology:

1.  **Identify Security-Relevant Commands:**
    *   **Objective:** Create a categorized list of all commands that manage security controls.
    *   **Categories:**
        *   **User Management:** `local-user`, `aaa`
        *   **Access Control:** `acl`, `firewall`
        *   **SNMP Configuration:** `snmp-agent`, `snmp-agent trap`
        *   **Logging and Auditing:** `info-center`, `logbuffer`
        *   **System Integrity:** `reboot`, `startup`, `patch`
        *   **Factory Reset:** `factory-reset`

2.  **Create "Dangerous Command" Warnings:**
    *   **Objective:** Explicitly warn users about commands that can have a severe negative impact if misused.
    *   **Process:**
        *   In the documentation for commands like `reboot`, `factory-reset`, or those that modify active firewall rules, add a prominent "Warning" or "Security Note" section.
        *   This section should clearly and concisely state the potential impact (e.g., "This command will immediately restart the device, causing a total service outage.").

3.  **Document Safe Configuration Practices:**
    *   **Objective:** Provide proactive security advice alongside the command reference.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Within the documentation for security configuration commands (e.g., `local-user`), include a sub-section with best-practice examples.
        *   For `local-user`, this would include examples of creating a user with a specific, non-default privilege level and enforcing a strong password.
        *   For `snmp-agent`, it would include an example of correctly configuring an SNMPv3 user with `authPriv` and an ACL.

# Task 4: G.993.2 Proprietary Extensions Analysis Framework

This document outlines a research framework for analyzing vendor-specific proprietary extensions to the ITU-T G.993.2 (VDSL2) standard as implemented by Huawei. The goal is to understand these extensions, their impact on performance and interoperability, and any potential security implications.

## Phase 1: Protocol Capture and Analysis

This phase focuses on observing the protocol in action to identify non-standard behavior and parameters. This is the most direct way to discover proprietary extensions without access to source code.

### Methodology:

1.  **Establish a Controlled Test Bed:**
    *   **Objective:** Create a lab environment where the G.hs (handshake) process can be reliably captured.
    *   **Setup:**
        *   A Huawei DSLAM (e.g., MA5600) and a compatible Huawei CPE (modem).
        *   A method to capture the signals on the copper pair. This is non-trivial and may require specialized hardware like a high-frequency differential probe and an oscilloscope or a dedicated DSL protocol analyzer.
        *   A secondary setup with a third-party, standards-compliant CPE for comparison.

2.  **Capture the G.hs Handshake:**
    *   **Objective:** Record the full VDSL2 handshake sequence.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Connect the capture equipment to the line between the DSLAM and CPE.
        *   Power on the CPE to initiate the handshake and training sequence.
        *   Record the entire exchange, from the initial tones to the final transition to "showtime" (data mode).

3.  **Decode and Analyze Handshake Messages:**
    *   **Objective:** Identify proprietary information fields within the standard G.994.1 (handshake) messages.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Use the ITU-T G.994.1 specification as a baseline to decode the captured handshake frames.
        *   Pay close attention to the "Non-Standard Information Field" (NSIF), which is the designated place for vendor-specific data.
        *   Document the structure of Huawei's NSIF. Look for proprietary TLV (Type-Length-Value) structures that encode information about custom features like non-standard vectoring modes, performance monitoring parameters, or special profile capabilities.
        *   Compare the handshake captured with the Huawei CPE against the one captured with the third-party CPE. Differences in the NSIF or other message fields will highlight the proprietary extensions.

## Phase 2: Firmware Analysis

This phase involves analyzing the device's firmware to find strings, commands, and configuration parameters that are not exposed in the standard documentation.

**Disclaimer:** Firmware should only be obtained legally from equipment that you own. Reverse engineering firmware may be restricted by vendor license agreements. This methodology is for academic research on legally obtained images.

### Methodology:

1.  **Firmware Extraction:**
    *   **Objective:** Obtain the firmware image from the device.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Download the firmware from the vendor's official support site (if available).
        *   Use the device's backup or update mechanism to extract the running firmware file, often a `.bin` or `.cc` file.

2.  **Static Analysis:**
    *   **Objective:** Search the firmware binary for interesting data.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Use the `strings` utility to extract all human-readable ASCII and Unicode strings from the binary.
        *   Pipe the output of `strings` to `grep` to search for keywords like `proprietary`, `vectoring`, `g.inp`, `profile`, `diag`, `debug`, or any other terms related to DSL performance and features.
        *   This can reveal hidden CLI commands, debug modes, or names of proprietary features.
        *   Use a binary analysis tool like Ghidra or IDA Pro to look for functions related to DSL line card initialization and configuration to better understand the logic.

## Phase 3: Configuration Parameter Discovery

This phase focuses on actively probing the device's management interfaces to discover and document undocumented configuration options.

### Methodology:

1.  **Enumerate Hidden CLI Commands:**
    *   **Objective:** Find CLI commands that are not revealed by the standard help (`?`) system.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Use the list of potential command names discovered during firmware analysis.
        *   Attempt to execute these commands directly in the appropriate CLI context (e.g., system view, DSL interface view).
        *   Some platforms have a "hidden" or "internal" help command (e.g., `_?` or `help internal`) that may reveal more commands.

2.  **Test Parameter Ranges and Validation:**
    *   **Objective:** Understand the boundaries and side effects of both documented and undocumented parameters.
    *   **Process:**
        *   For a given parameter (e.g., a profile setting), systematically test values outside the documented range.
        *   For example, if a parameter is documented to accept values from 1-100, try 0, 101, -1, and very large numbers to observe the device's error handling.
        *   This can reveal hidden flags or behaviors (e.g., a value of 0 might enable a special automatic mode).

## Phase 4: Interoperability Testing

This final phase assesses the real-world impact of proprietary extensions by testing how they affect third-party equipment.

### Methodology:

1.  **Establish Baseline with Standard-Compliant Mode:**
    *   **Objective:** Measure performance with all proprietary features disabled.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Connect the Huawei DSLAM to a third-party, standards-compliant CPE.
        *   Configure the DSLAM port to use a standard VDSL2 profile with no vendor-specific enhancements enabled.
        *   Measure key performance indicators (KPIs): sync rate, latency, error counts (CRC, FEC), and stability over time.

2.  **Enable Proprietary Features and Re-test:**
    *   **Objective:** Measure the performance and behavior when proprietary extensions are active.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Enable Huawei-specific features on the DSLAM port (e.g., a proprietary vectoring mode or a special profile).
        *   Observe the CPE's behavior. Does it connect? Does it fall back to a more basic mode? Does it report errors?
        *   If it connects, re-measure the same KPIs. This will show whether the proprietary feature provides a benefit, has no effect, or causes a degradation in interoperability.

3.  **Document Fallback Behavior:**
    *   **Objective:** Understand how the system behaves when one side does not support the other's extensions.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Document the results of the interoperability tests, paying close attention to fallback mechanisms.
        *   A well-behaved implementation should gracefully fall back to a standard-compliant mode. A poor implementation might fail to connect or exhibit instability. This is a key finding for any network operator using multi-vendor equipment.
